<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the city lived the shoemaker, Martuin
Avdyeitch. He lived in a basement, in a
little room with one window. The window
looked out on the street. Through the
window he used to watch the people passing
by; although only their feet could be seen,
yet by the boots, Martuin Avdyeitch recognized
the people. Martuin Avdyeitch had
lived long in one place, and had many
acquaintances. Few pairs of boots in his
district had not been in his hands once and
again. Some he would half-sole, some he
would patch, some he would stitch around,
and occasionally he would also put on new
uppers. And through the window he often
recognized his work.</p>

<p>Avdyeitch had plenty to do, because he
was a faithful workman, used good material,
did not make exorbitant charges, and kept
his word. If it was possible for him to finish
an order by a certain time, he would accept
it; otherwise, he would not deceive you,&mdash;he
would tell you so beforehand. And all
knew Avdyeitch, and he was never out of
work.</p>

<p>Avdyeitch had always been a good man;
but as he grew old, he began to think more
about his soul, and get nearer to God.
Martuin's wife had died when he was still
living with his master. His wife left him a
boy three years old. None of their other
children had lived. All the eldest had died
in childhood. Martuin at first intended to
send his little son to his sister in the village,
but afterward he felt sorry for him; he
thought to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be hard for my Kapitoshka to live
in a strange family. I shall keep him with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Avdyeitch left his master, and went
into lodgings with his little son. But God
gave Avdyeitch no luck with his children.
As Kapitoshka grew older, he began to help
his father, and would have been a delight to
him, but a sickness fell on him, he went to
bed, suffered a week, and died. Martuin
buried his son, and fell into despair. So
deep was this despair that he began to
complain of God. Martuin fell into such
a melancholy state, that more than once
he prayed to God for death, and reproached
God because He had not taken him who
was an old man, instead of his beloved
only son. Avdyeitch also ceased to go to
church.</p>

<p>And once a little old man from the same
district came from Tro√Øtsa<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> to see Avdyeitch;
for seven years he had been wandering about.
Avdyeitch talked with him, and began to
complain about his sorrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to live any longer,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I only wish I was dead. That is all
I pray God for. I am a man without anything
to hope for now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little old man said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't talk right, Martuin, we must
not judge God's doings. The world moves,
not by our skill, but by God's will. God
decreed for your son to die,&mdash;for you&mdash;to
live. So it is for the best. And you are in
despair, because you wish to live for your
own happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what shall one live for?&rdquo; asked
Martuin.</p>

<p>And the little old man said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must live for God, Martuin. He
gives you life, and for His sake you must
live. When you begin to live for Him, you
will not grieve over anything, and all will
seem easy to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martuin kept silent for a moment, and then
said, &ldquo;But how can one live for God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little old man said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christ has taught us how to live for God.
You know how to read? Buy a Testament,
and read it; there you will learn how to live
for God. Everything is explained there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And these words kindled a fire in
Avdyeitch's heart. And he went that very
same day, bought a New Testament in large
print, and began to read.</p>

<p>At first Avdyeitch intended to read only on
holidays; but as he began to read, it so
cheered his soul that he used to read every
day. At times he would become so absorbed
in reading, that all the kerosene in the lamp
would burn out, and still he could not tear
himself away. And so Avdyeitch used to
read every evening.</p>

<p>And the more he read, the clearer he
understood what God wanted of him, and
how one should live for God; and his heart
kept growing easier and easier. Formerly,
when he lay down to sleep, he used to sigh
and groan, and always thought of his
Kapitoshka; and now his only exclamation
was:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory to Thee! glory to Thee, Lord!
Thy will be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from that time Avdyeitch's whole life
was changed. In other days he, too, used to
drop into a public-house<a name="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> as a holiday amusement,
to drink a cup of tea; and he was not
averse to a little brandy, either. He would
take a drink with some acquaintance, and
leave the saloon, not intoxicated, exactly, yet
in a happy frame of mind, and inclined to
talk nonsense, and shout, and use abusive
language at a person. Now he left off that
sort of thing. His life became quiet and
joyful. In the morning he would sit down
to work, finish his allotted task, then take
the little lamp from the hook, put it on the
table, get his book from the shelf, open it,
and sit down to read. And the more he read,
the more he understood, and the brighter and
happier it grew in his heart.</p>

<p>Once it happened that Martuin read till
late into the night. He was reading the
Gospel of Luke. He was reading over the
sixth chapter; and he was reading the
verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And unto him that smiteth thee on the
one cheek offer also the other; and him that
taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy
coat also. Give to every man that asketh of
thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods
ask them not again. And as ye would that
men should do to you, do ye also to them
likewise.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He read farther also those verses, where
God speaks:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do
not the things which I say? Whosoever cometh
to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them,
I will shew you to whom he is like: he is like
a man which built an house, and digged deep,
and laid the foundation on a rock: and when
the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently
upon that house, and could not shake it; for it
was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth,
and doeth not, is like a man that without a
foundation built an house upon the earth;
against which the stream did beat vehemently,
and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that
house was great.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch read these words, and joy filled
his soul. He took off his spectacles, put
them down on the book, leaned his elbows
on the table, and became lost in thought.
And he began to measure his life by these
words. And he thought to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my house built on the rock, or on the
sand? 'Tis well if on the rock. It is so
easy when you are alone by yourself; it
seems as if you had done everything as God
commands; but when you forget yourself,
you sin again. Yet I shall still struggle on.
It is very good. Help me, Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus ran his thoughts; he wanted to go to
bed, but he felt loath to tear himself away
from the book. And he began to read farther
in the seventh chapter. He read about the
centurion, he read about the widow's son,
he read about the answer given to John's
disciples, and finally he came to that place
where the rich Pharisee desired the Lord to
sit at meat with him; and he read how the
woman that was a sinner anointed His feet,
and washed them with her tears, and how
He forgave her. He reached the forty-fourth
verse, and began to read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And he turned to the woman, and said
unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered
into thine house, thou gavest me no water for
my feet: but she hath washed my feet with
tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her
head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this
woman since the time I came in hath not ceased
to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst
not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my
feet with ointment.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He finished reading these verses, and
thought to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Thou gavest me no water for my feet, thou
gavest me no kiss. My head with oil thou
didst not anoint.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again Avdyeitch took off his spectacles,
put them down on the book, and again he
became lost in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that Pharisee must have been
such a man as I am. I, too, apparently have
thought only of myself,&mdash;how I might have
my tea, be warm and comfortable, but never
to think about my guest. He thought about
himself, but there was not the least care taken
of the guest. And who was his guest? The
Lord Himself. If He had come to me, should
I have done the same way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch rested his head upon both his
arms, and did not notice that he fell asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martuin!&rdquo; suddenly seemed to sound in
his ears.</p>

<p>Martuin started from his sleep:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned around, glanced toward the
door&mdash;no one.</p>

<p>Again he fell into a doze. Suddenly, he
plainly heard:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martuin! Ah, Martuin! look to-morrow
on the street. I am coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martuin awoke, rose from the chair, began
to rub his eyes. He himself could not tell
whether he heard those words in his dream,
or in reality. He turned down his lamp, and
went to bed.</p>

<p>At daybreak next morning, Avdyeitch rose,
made his prayer to God, lighted the stove,
put on the shchi<a name="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> and the kasha,<a name="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> put the
water in the samovar, put on his apron, and
sat down by the window to work.</p>

<p>And while he was working, he kept thinking
about all that had happened the day before.
It seemed to him at one moment that it was
a dream, and now he had really heard a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;such things
have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martuin was sitting by the window, and
looking out more than he was working.
When anyone passed by in boots which he
did not know, he would bend down, look out
of the window, in order to see, not only the
feet, but also the face.</p>

<p>The dvornik<a name="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> passed by in new felt boots,<a name="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">(6)</a>
the water-carrier passed by; then there came
up to the window an old soldier of Nicholas's
time, in an old pair of laced felt boots, with
a shovel in his hands. Avdyeitch recognized
him by his felt boots. The old man's name
was Stepanuitch; and a neighboring merchant,
out of charity, gave him a home with
him. He was required to assist the dvornik.
Stepanuitch began to shovel away the snow
from in front of Avdyeitch's window.
Avdyeitch glanced at him, and took up his
work again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I must be getting crazy in my
old age,&rdquo; said Avdyeitch, and laughed at
himself. &ldquo;Stepanuitch is clearing away the
snow, and I imagine that Christ is coming to
see me. I was entirely out of my mind, old
dotard that I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch sewed about a dozen stitches,
and then felt impelled to look through the
window again. He looked out again through
the window, and saw that Stepanuitch had
leaned his shovel against the wall, and was
warming himself, and resting. He was an
old, broken-down man; evidently he had not
strength enough even to shovel the snow.
Avdyeitch said to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give him some tea; by the way,
the samovar has only just gone out.&rdquo;
Avdyeitch laid down his awl, rose from his
seat, put the samovar on the table, poured
out the tea, and tapped with his finger at the
glass. Stepanuitch turned around, and came
to the window. Avdyeitch beckoned to him,
and went to open the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, warm yourself a little,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You must be cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May Christ reward you for this! my
bones ache,&rdquo; said Stepanuitch.</p>

<p>Stepanuitch came in, and shook off the
snow, tried to wipe his feet, so as not to soil
the floor, but staggered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't trouble to wipe your feet. I will
clean it up myself; we are used to such
things. Come in and sit down,&rdquo; said
Avdyeitch. &ldquo;Here, drink a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Avdyeitch lifted two glasses, and
handed one to his guest; while he himself
poured his tea into a saucer, and began to
blow it.</p>

<p>Stepanuitch finished drinking his glass of
tea, turned the glass upside down,<a name="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> put the
half-eaten lump of sugar on it, and began to
express his thanks. But it was evident he
wanted some more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some more,&rdquo; said Avdyeitch, filling
both his own glass and his guest's. Avdyeitch
drank his tea, but from time to time glanced
out into the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you expecting anyone?&rdquo; asked his
guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I expecting anyone? I am ashamed
even to tell whom I expect. I am, and I am
not, expecting someone; but one word has
kindled a fire in my heart. Whether it is a
dream, or something else, I do not know.
Don't you see, brother, I was reading yesterday
the Gospel about Christ the Batyushka;
how He suffered, how He walked on the earth.
I suppose you have heard about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have,&rdquo; replied Stepanuitch; &ldquo;but
we are people in darkness, we can't read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I was reading about that very
thing,&mdash;how He walked on the earth; I read,
you know, how He came to the Pharisee, and
the Pharisee did not treat Him hospitably.
Well, and so, my brother, I was reading
yesterday, about this very thing, and was
thinking to myself how he did not receive
Christ, the Batyushka, with honor. Suppose,
for example, He should come to me, or anyone
else, I said to myself, I should not even
know how to receive Him. And he gave
Him no reception at all. Well! while I was
thus thinking, I fell asleep, brother, and I
heard someone call me by name. I got up;
the voice, just as if someone whispered, said,
&lsquo;Be on the watch; I shall come to-morrow.&rsquo;
And this happened twice. Well! would you
believe it, it got into my head? I scolded
myself&mdash;and yet I am expecting Him, the
Batyushka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stepanuitch shook his head, and said
nothing; he finished drinking his glass of tea,
and put it on the side; but Avdyeitch picked
up the glass again, and filled it once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink some more for your good health.
You see, I have an idea that, when the
Batyushka went about on this earth, He
disdained no one, and had more to do with
the simple people. He always went to
see the simple people. He picked out His
disciples more from among folk like such
sinners as we are, from the working class.
Said He, whoever exalts himself, shall be
humbled, and he who is humbled shall become
exalted. Said He, you call me Lord,
and, said He, I wash your feet. Whoever
wishes, said He, to be the first, the same
shall be a servant to all. Because, said He,
blessed are the poor, the humble, the kind,
the generous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Stepanuitch forgot about his tea; he
was an old man, and easily moved to tears.
He was listening, and the tears rolled down
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now, have some more tea,&rdquo; said
Avdyeitch; but Stepanuitch made the sign of
the cross, thanked him, turned down his
glass, and arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Martuin
Avdyeitch, for treating me kindly, and satisfying
me, soul and body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome; come in again; always
glad to see a friend,&rdquo; said Avdyeitch.</p>

<p>Stepanuitch departed; and Martuin poured
out the rest of the tea, drank it up, put away
the dishes, and sat down again by the window
to work, to stitch on a patch. He kept
stitching away, and at the same time looking
through the window. He was expecting
Christ, and was all the while thinking of Him
and His deeds, and his head was filled with
the different speeches of Christ.</p>

<p>Two soldiers passed by: one wore boots
furnished by the crown, and the other one,
boots that he had made; then the master<a name="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">(8)</a> of
the next house passed by in shining galoshes;
then a baker with a basket passed by. All
passed by; and now there came also by the
window a woman in woolen stockings and
rustic bashmaks on her feet. She passed
by the window, and stood still near the
window-case.</p>

<p>Avdyeitch looked up at her from the
window, and saw it was a stranger, a woman
poorly clad, and with a child; she was standing
by the wall with her back to the wind, trying
to wrap up the child, and she had nothing to
wrap it up in. The woman was dressed in
shabby summer clothes; and from behind
the frame, Avdyeitch could hear the child
crying, and the woman trying to pacify it;
but she was not able to pacify it.</p>

<p>Avdyeitch got up, went to the door, ascended
the steps, and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good woman. Hey! my good
woman!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">(9)</a></p>

<p>The woman heard him and turned around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you standing in the cold with
the child? Come into my room, where it is
warm; you can manage it better. Here,
this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman was astonished. She saw an
old, old man in an apron, with spectacles on
his nose, calling her to him. She followed
him. They descended the steps and entered
the room; the old man led the woman to
his bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;sit down, my good
woman, nearer to the stove; you can get
warm, and nurse the little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no milk for him. I myself have
not eaten anything since morning,&rdquo; said the
woman; but, nevertheless, she took the baby
to her breast.</p>

<p>Avdyeitch shook his head, went to the table,
brought out the bread and a dish, opened the
oven door, poured into the dish some cabbage
soup, took out the pot with the gruel,
but it was not cooked as yet; so he filled the
dish with shchi only, and put it on the table.
He got the bread, took the towel down from
the hook, and spread it upon the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and eat, my good
woman; and I will mind the little one. You
see, I once had children of my own; I know
how to handle them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman crossed herself, sat down at
the table, and began to eat; while Avdyeitch
took a seat on the bed near the infant.
Avdyeitch kept smacking and smacking to it
with his lips; but it was a poor kind of
smacking, for he had no teeth. The little
one kept on crying. And it occured to
Avdyeitch to threaten the little one with his
finger; he waved, waved his finger right
before the child's mouth, and hastily withdrew
it. He did not put it to its mouth,
because his finger was black, and soiled with
wax. And the little one looked at his finger,
and became quiet; then it began to smile,
and Avdyeitch also was glad. While the
woman was eating, she told who she was,
and whither she was going.</p>

<p>Said she:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a soldier's wife. It is now seven
months since they sent my husband away off,
and no tidings. I lived out as cook; the
baby was born; no one cared to keep me
with a child. This is the third month that
I have been struggling along without a place.
I ate up all I had. I wanted to engage as a
wet-nurse&mdash;no one would take me&mdash;I am
too thin, they say. I have just been to the
merchant's wife, where lives a young woman
I know, and so they promised to take us in.
I thought that was the end of it. But she
told me to come next week. And she lives
a long way off. I got tired out; and it tired
him, too, my heart's darling. Fortunately,
our landlady takes pity on us for the sake
of Christ, and gives us a room, else I don't
know how I should manage to get along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch sighed, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't you any warm clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now is the time, friend, to wear warm
clothes; but yesterday I pawned my last
shawl for a twenty-kopek piece.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">(10)</a></p>

<p>The woman came to the bed, and took the
child; and Avdyeitch rose, went to the partition,
rummaged round, and succeeded in
finding an old coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;It is a poor thing, yet
you may turn it to some use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked at the coat and looked
at the old man; she took the coat, and burst
into tears; and Avdyeitch turned away his
head; crawling under the bed, he pushed out
a little trunk, rummaged in it, and sat down
again opposite the woman.</p>

<p>And the woman said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May Christ bless you, little grandfather!<a name="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">(11)</a>
He must have sent me to your window. My
little baby would have frozen to death. When
I started out it was warm, but now it has
grown cold. And He, the Batyushka, led
you to look through the window and take
pity on me, an unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch smiled, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, He did that! I have been looking
through the window, my good woman, for
some wise reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Martuin told the soldier's wife his
dream, and how he heard the voice,&mdash;how
the Lord promised to come and see him
that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things are possible,&rdquo; said the
woman. She rose, put on the coat,
wrapped up her little child in it; and, as
she started to take leave, she thanked
Avdyeitch again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this, for Christ's sake,&rdquo; said Avdyeitch,
giving her a twenty-kopek piece;
&ldquo;redeem your shawl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made the sign of the cross, and Avdyeitch
made the sign of the cross and went
with her to the door.</p>

<p>The woman went away. Avdyeitch ate
some shchi, washed the dishes, and sat down
again to work. While he was working he
still remembered the window; when the
window grew darker he immediately looked
out to see who was passing by. Acquaintances
passed by and strangers passed by, and there
was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>But here Avdyeitch saw that an old apple
woman had stopped in front of his window.
She carried a basket with apples. Only a few
were left, as she had evidently sold them
nearly all out; and over her shoulder she had
a bag full of chips. She must have gathered
them up in some new building, and was on
her way home. One could see that the bag
was heavy on her shoulder; she tried to shift
it to the other shoulder. So she lowered the
bag on the sidewalk, stood the basket with
the apples on a little post, and began to shake
down the splinters in the bag. And while
she was shaking her bag, a little boy in a torn
cap came along, picked up an apple from the
basket, and was about to make his escape;
but the old woman noticed it, turned around,
and caught the youngster by his sleeve. The
little boy began to struggle, tried to tear himself
away; but the old woman grasped him
with both hands, knocked off his cap, and
caught him by the hair.</p>

<p>The little boy was screaming, the old
woman was scolding. Avdyeitch lost no
time in putting away his awl; he threw it
upon the floor, sprang to the door,&mdash;he
even stumbled on the stairs, and dropped
his spectacles,&mdash;and rushed out into the
street.</p>

<p>The old woman was pulling the youngster
by his hair, and was scolding and threatening
to take him to the policeman; the youngster
was defending himself, and denying the charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not take it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;What are
you licking me for? Let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch tried to separate them. He took
the boy by his arm, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him go, babushka; forgive him, for
Christ's sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will forgive him so that he won't forget
it till the new broom grows. I am going to
take the little villain to the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avdyeitch began to entreat the old woman:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him go, babushka,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he
will never do it again. Let him go, for
Christ's sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman let him loose; the boy
started to run, but Avdyeitch kept him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask the babushka's forgiveness,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and don't you ever do it again; I saw you
take the apple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy burst into tears, and began to ask
forgiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now! that's right; and here's an
apple for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Avdyeitch took an apple from the
basket, and gave it to the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pay you for it, babushka,&rdquo; he said
to the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ruin them that way, the good-for-nothings,&rdquo;
said the old woman. &ldquo;He ought
to be treated so that he would remember it
for a whole week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, babushka, babushka,&rdquo; said Avdyeitch,
&ldquo;that is right according to our judgment, but
not according to God's. If he is to be whipped
for an apple, then what ought to be done to
us for our sins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman was silent.</p>

<p>And Avdyeitch told her the parable of the
master who forgave a debtor all that he owed
him, and how the debtor went and began to
choke one who owed him.</p>

<p>The old woman listened, and the boy
stood listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has commanded us to forgive,&rdquo; said
Avdyeitch, &ldquo;else we, too, may not be forgiven.
All should be forgiven, and the thoughtless
especially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman shook her head, and sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but the trouble is
that they are very much spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we who are older must teach them,&rdquo;
said Avdyeitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what I say,&rdquo; remarked the
old woman. &ldquo;I myself have had seven of
them,&mdash;only one daughter is left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the old woman began to relate where
and how she lived with her daughter, and
how many grandchildren she had. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo;
she says, &ldquo;my strength is only so-so, and
yet I have to work. I pity the youngsters&mdash;my
grandchildren&mdash;but what nice children
they are! No one gives me such a welcome
as they do. Aksintka won't go to anyone but
me. &lsquo;Babushka, dear babushka, lovliest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the old woman grew quite sentimental.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it is a childish trick. God be
with him,&rdquo; said she, pointing to the boy.</p>

<p>The woman was just about to lift the bag
up on her shoulder, when the boy ran up,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me carry it, babushka; it is on my
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman nodded her head, and put
the bag on the boy's back.</p>

<p>And side by side they passed along the
street.</p>

<p>And the old woman even forgot to ask
Avdyeitch to pay for the apple. Avdyeitch
stood motionless, and kept gazing after them;
and he heard them talking all the time as they
walked away. After Avdyeitch saw them
disappear, he returned to his room; he found
his eye-glasses on the stairs,&mdash;they were not
broken; he picked up his awl, and sat down
to work again.</p>

<p>After working a little while, it grew darker,
so that he could not see to sew; he saw the
lamplighter passing by to light the street-lamps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be time to make a light,&rdquo; he said
to himself; so he got his little lamp ready,
hung it up, and he took himself again to his
work. He had one boot already finished;
he turned it around, looked at it: &ldquo;Well
done.&rdquo; He put away his tools, swept off the
cuttings, cleared off the bristles and ends,
took the lamp, set it on the table, and took
down the Gospels from the shelf. He intended
to open the book at the very place where he
had yesterday put a piece of leather as a mark,
but it happened to open at another place; and
the moment Avdyeitch opened the Testament,
he recollected his last night's dream. And as
soon as he remembered it, it seemed as if he
heard someone stepping about behind him.
Avdyeitch looked around, and saw&mdash;there,
in the dark corner, it seemed as if people were
standing; he was at a loss to know who they
were. And a voice whispered in his ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martuin&mdash;ah, Martuin! did you not
recognize me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; exclaimed Avdyeitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; repeated the voice. &ldquo;It was I;&rdquo;
and Stepanuitch stepped forth from the dark
corner; he smiled, and like a little cloud
faded away, and soon vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was I,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>

<p>From the dark corner stepped forth the
woman with her child; the woman smiled,
the child laughed, and they also vanished,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was I,&rdquo; continued the voice; both
the old woman and the boy with the apple
stepped forward; both smiled and vanished.</p>

<p>Avdyeitch's soul rejoiced; he crossed himself,
put on his spectacles, and began to read
the Evangelists where it happened to open.
On the upper part of the page he read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me
meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink;
I was a stranger, and ye took me in.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And on the lower part of the page he read
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
unto me.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;St. Matthew, Chap.&nbsp;xxv.</p>

<p>And Avdyeitch understood that his dream
had not deceived him; that the Saviour really
called on him that day, and that he really
received Him.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
